============

This is a basic rails app using Rails version 4.2.4.  This is a learning exercise,
not intended to be a production application.  At present there is no styling, 
and the application itself is built in "vanilla" Rails with no additional features.

What is currently here was built over a two day period, November 8th to the 9th 2015.
There are still more features to be added, a well as styling, but that will occur after
other projects.
